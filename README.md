# Pr√©requis



1. _**\[CRUCIAL]**_ Time and patience.
   * Don't start working on this if you have deadlines or important work. Hackintoshes are not something you should be relying on as a work machine.
2. _**\[CRUCIAL]**_ **KNOW YOUR HARDWARE**
   * Your CPU name and its generation
   * Your GPUs
   * Your storage devices (HDD/SSD, NVMe/AHCI/RAID/IDE configuration)
   * Your laptop/desktop model if from an OEM
   * Your **Ethernet chipset**
   * Your WLAN/Bluetooth chipset
3. _**\[CRUCIAL]**_ **A BASIC KNOWLEDGE OF COMMAND LINES AND HOW TO USE A TERMINAL/COMMAND PROMPT**
   * This is not just \[CRUCIAL], this is the basis of this whole guide. We can't help you if you don't know how to `cd` to a directory or delete a file.
4. _**\[CRUCIAL]**_ A machine that is compatible as seen in the _**Compatibility**_ section.
   * [Hardware Limitations page](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Install-Guide/macos-limits.html)
5. _**\[CRUCIAL]**_ A minimum of:
   * 16GB USB if you're going to use macOS to create the USB
   * 4GB USB if you're going to use Windows or Linux for USB creation
6. _**\[CRUCIAL]**_ An **Ethernet connection** (no WiFi dongles, Ethernet USB adapter may work depending on macOS support) and you must know your LAN card's model
   * You must either have a physical Ethernet port, or a compatible macOS Ethernet dongle/adapter. In case you have a [compatible WiFi card (opens new window)](https://dortania.github.io/Wireless-Buyers-Guide/), you can also use that.
     * Note the majority of WiFi cards are not supported by macOS
   * For people who can't use ethernet but have an Android phone, you can connect your Android phone to WiFi and then tether it using USB with [HoRNDIS (opens new window)](https://joshuawise.com/horndis#available\_versions).
7. _**\[CRUCIAL]**_ **Proper OS Installation:**
   * Be it:
     * macOS (a fairly recent one would be better)
     * Windows (Windows 10, 1703 or newer)
     * Linux (Clean and properly functioning, with Python 2.7 or later)
   * For Windows or Linux users, **15GB** of free space on the drive you're working on. On Windows, your OS disk (C:) must have at least **15GB** of free space.
   * For macOS users, **30GB** of free space on the system's drive.
   * Most tools used in this guide will also require [Python installed](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
